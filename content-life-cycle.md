### Step 1: Adi Registers a Complaint

* Entities Involved: User, Category, Complaint, Sub\_Category\_Mappings, Audit Log
* Process:
  1. Adi Logs In: Adi (User ID: "USR-2025-000008") logs into the system via OAuth using their email.
  2. Adi Submits Complaint:
     * Category: "Environment"
     * Sub\_Category: "Illegal dumping of waste"
     * Description: "Illegal waste dumping in XYZ Nagar park."
     * Location: { "PIN": "400001", "District": "Mumbai District", "City": "Mumbai", "Locality": "XYZ Nagar", "Street": "Park Road", "Geolocation": { "lat": 12.35, "long": 56.79 } }
     * Urgency: "High"
     * Attachment: "[https://cloudstorage.example.com/waste.jpg](https://cloudstorage.example.com/waste.jpg)"
     * Is\_Public: true
  3. Complaint Creation:
     *   A new Complaint record is created:json

         ```json
         {
           "complaint_id": "CMP-2025-123457",
           "submission_date": "2025-05-13T17:21:00+05:30",
           "complainant": "USR-2025-000008",
           "category": "Environment",
           "sub_category": "Illegal dumping of waste",
           "standardized_sub_category": null,
           "description": "Illegal waste dumping in XYZ Nagar park.",
           "location": {
             "PIN": "400001",
             "District": "Mumbai District",

           "assigned_department": "Environment",
           "status": "Registered",
           "sla": "5 days",
           "assigned_agent": null,
           "co_assigned_agents": [],
           "upvote_count": 0,
           "is_public": true,
           "feedback": null,
           "resolution_notes": null,
           "escalation_level": "DepartmentMunicipal",
           "date_of_resolution": null
         }
         ```
     * The complaint is added to User.current\_complaints: \["CMP-2025-123457"].
  4. AI Standardization:
     * The system standardizes "Illegal dumping of waste" to "Waste Dumping" using NLP.
     *   A new Sub\_Category\_Mappings record is created:json

         ```json
         {
           "mapping_id": "SCM-2025-000002",
           "category": "Environment",
           "original_sub_category": "Illegal dumping of waste",
           "standardized_sub_category": "Waste Dumping",
           "created_by": "System",
           "creation_date": "2025-05-13T17:21:05+05:30",
           "last_updated": "2025-05-13T17:21:05+05:30"
         }
         ```
     * Complaint.standardized\_sub\_category is updated to "Waste Dumping".
  5. Audit Log Entry:
     *   An AuditLog entry is created:json

         ```json
         {
           "log_id": "LOG-2025-000008",
           "action": "Complaint Submitted",
           "user_id": "USR-2025-000008",
           "complaint_id": "CMP-2025-123457",
           "timestamp": "2025-05-13T17:21:05+05:30",
           "details": "Complaint submitted by user USR-2025-000008"
         }
         ```
* Role of Entities:
  * User: Submits the complaint.
  * Category: Provides category and sub-category options.
  * Complaint: Stores the complaint details.
  * Sub\_Category\_Mappings: Records the AI-standardized sub-category.
  * Audit Log: Logs the submission action.

***

### Step 2: Complaint Routed to Department Municipal Admin

* Entities Involved: Complaint, Category, DepartmentMunicipalAdmin, Audit Log
* Process:
  1. Routing Based on Category:
     * The complaintâ€™s category ("Environment") maps to the "Environment" department in Category.assigned\_department.
     * The system identifies the DepartmentMunicipalAdmin for the Environment department in Mumbai Ward 5 (based on Complaint.location): Neha Patel (User ID: "USR-2025-000009", department: "Environment", municipality: "Mumbai Ward 5").
     * The complaint is added to DepartmentMunicipalAdmin.managed\_complaints: \["CMP-2025-123457"].
  2. Department-Specific Handling:
     * Since "Environment" is a regulatory category (not operational like Infrastructure), it cannot be resolved by an Agent. Neha reviews the complaint and decides to escalate it to the corresponding DepartmentStateAdmin.
     * Complaint.status is updated to "Under Processing".
  3. Audit Log Entry:
     *   An AuditLog entry is created:json

         ```json
         {
           "log_id": "LOG-2025-000009",
           "action": "Complaint Routed",
           "user_id": "USR-2025-000009",
           "complaint_id": "CMP-2025-123457",
           "timestamp": "2025-05-13T17:25:00+05:30",
           "details": "Routed to DepartmentMunicipalAdmin USR-2025-000009 (Environment)"
         }
         ```
* Role of Entities:
  * Complaint: Updated with the initial escalation level and status.
  * Category: Used to determine the department for routing.
  * DepartmentMunicipalAdmin: Receives the complaint and decides the next step.
  * Audit Log: Logs the routing action.

***

### Step 3: Escalation to Department State Admin

* Entities Involved: Complaint, DepartmentMunicipalAdmin, DepartmentStateAdmin, Audit Log
* Process:

       * escalation\_level: "DepartmentState"
     * The complaint is added to DepartmentStateAdmin.escalated\_complaints: \["CMP-2025-123457"].
     * DepartmentMunicipalAdmin.performance.escalation\_count is incremented to 4.
  2. Department State Admin Action:
     * Arjun reviews the complaint and coordinates with environmental regulators to address the illegal dumping. He updates the resolution\_notes: "Coordinating with environmental regulator for cleanup and fines."
  3. Audit Log Entry:
     *   An AuditLog entry is created:json

         ```json
         {
           "log_id": "LOG-2025-000010",
           "action": "Complaint Escalated",
           "user_id": "USR-2025-000009",
           "complaint_id": "CMP-2025-123457",
           "timestamp": "2025-05-13T17:30:00+05:30",
           "details": "Escalated to DepartmentStateAdmin USR-2025-000010 (Environment) by DepartmentMunicipalAdmin USR-2025-000009"
         }
         ```
* Role of Entities:
  * Complaint: Updated with new escalation level and resolution notes.
  * DepartmentMunicipalAdmin: Initiates the escalation.

           "timestamp": "2025-05-13T17:35:00+05:30"
         }
         ```
     * Complaint.upvote\_count is updated to 1.
  3. Audit Log Entry:
     *   An AuditLog entry is created:json

         ```json
         {
